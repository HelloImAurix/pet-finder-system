# ✅ Final Verification Checklist

## Step 1: Verify Environment Variables in Railway

1. Go to Railway dashboard → Your service → **Variables** tab
2. Make sure these are set:
   - ✅ `LUARMOR_API_KEY` = `d0b0073a437fdbc540f31088ccf7e5f86170b173a0ef8ab176a9`
   - ✅ `LUARMOR_PROJECT_ID` = `7e771572421c77e6fbf41c5f796cd6ce`

## Step 2: Check Deployment Logs

1. Railway dashboard → Your service → **Deploy Logs** tab
2. Look for these messages:
   ```
   ✅ [API] LuArmor API Key: ✅ Configured
   ✅ [API] LuArmor Project ID: ✅ Configured
   ✅ [API] Pet Finder API Server running on port 3000
   ```

   **If you see "❌ Not configured"**, the environment variables aren't set correctly.

## Step 3: Test API Endpoints

### Test Health Endpoint
Open in browser:
```
https://empathetic-transformation-production.up.railway.app/api/health
```
Should return: `{"success": true, "status": "running", ...}`

### Test Key Verification
Test with a valid user key:
```
https://empathetic-transformation-production.up.railway.app/api/verify-key
```
(Use POST request with `X-API-Key` header)

## Step 4: Update Bot Scripts (Already Done ✅)

Your scripts are already updated with the correct URL:
- ✅ `PetFinderBot.lua` - Uses correct Railway URL
- ✅ `PetFinderGUI.lua` - Uses correct Railway URL

## Step 5: Ready to Use!

1. **Load `PetFinderBot.lua`** on your bot accounts
   - Users need to set their LuArmor license key in the script:
   ```lua
   local API_KEY = "user-luarmor-license-key"
   ```

2. **Load `PetFinderGUI.lua`** on your main account
   - No configuration needed, it will fetch finds automatically

3. **Watch the magic happen!**
   - Bots will find pets and send to API
   - GUI will display finds with green join buttons
   - Click JOIN to teleport to servers with pets

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Everything should be working now:
- ✅ Server deployed on Railway
- ✅ Environment variables set
- ✅ Scripts updated with correct URLs
- ✅ Security features enabled (batching, auth, rate limiting)

## 🐛 If Something's Not Working

**Bots not sending finds?**
- Check API_URL in bot script matches Railway URL
- Verify user's LuArmor license key is valid
- Check Railway logs for errors

**GUI not showing finds?**
- Check API_URL in GUI script matches Railway URL
- Verify server is running (check /api/health)
- Check browser console for errors

**LuArmor verification failing?**
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Check Railway logs for LuArmor API errors
- Verify user's LuArmor license key is valid
